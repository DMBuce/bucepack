**Manual Intervention Required**: Storage Orbs is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you've previously used the Storage Orbs datapack, I recommend taking a moment to update to the latest version, crack all your storage orbs to turn them back into shulker boxes, and then uninstall the datapack.

Changelog:

* {!tail -n+5 "$file"}

See the README for a complete description of all packs: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/tree/$version#buces-packs

Note that Hardcore Lichdom hasn't been updated and only works on Minecraft 1.16.
