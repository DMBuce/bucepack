BucePack is composed of textures and code that are distributed under several
different terms and conditions.

All Minecraft textures are modified and/or distributed under the Minecraft
Terms of Use <https://minecraft.net/terms> and Brand Guidelines
<https://minecraft.net/brand> .

The saddle.png is borrowed from reddit user /u/the_form_scattered
<http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/12ah90/i_added_a_little_bit_to_the_saddle_texture_i_love/c6tq9ut> ,
whose account is deleted. His saddle texture is redistributed in good faith
under the assumption that he wouldn't have created a one-off texture and
linked it on a popular social media site where reposting is common if he did
not want others to share it. /u/the_form_scattered, if you're reading this and
want me to remove your texture, just get in touch with me and I will gladly
oblige.

Any textures belonging to me are released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/> . Most of the textures I've
created are modified versions of old Minecraft textures, so if you want to
redistribute them you may need to also follow the Minecraft TOS and Brand
Guidelines. I am not a lawyer so caveat emptor applies here.

All code included in the BucePack git repository is released under the WTFPL
<http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/> .
