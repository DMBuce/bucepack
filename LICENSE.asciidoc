BucePack is composed of textures and code that are distributed under several
different terms and conditions.

All Minecraft textures are modified and/or distributed under the Minecraft
Terms of Use <https://minecraft.net/terms> and Brand Guidelines
<https://minecraft.net/brand> .

Any textures belonging to me are released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/> . Most of the textures I've
created are modified versions of old Minecraft textures, so if you want to
redistribute them you may need to also follow the Minecraft TOS and Brand
Guidelines. I am not a lawyer so caveat emptor applies here.

All code included in the BucePack git repository is released under the WTFPL
<http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/> .
