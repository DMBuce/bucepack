=== Note Guide


Adds a display to the top of note blocks that shows the note it's tuned to
and its position on a keyboard.

image::https://i.imgur.com/Nb8e9mn.png[Note Guide]

Unfortunately, note blocks don't have an orientation, so in this texture pack,
the direction they face depends on the instrument it's set to, i.e. the
block underneath:

* Facing West: bass, snare, hat, basedrum (wood/sand/glass/stone)
* Facing North: harp, guitar, iron_xylophone, xylophone (dirt/wool/iron/bone)
* Facing South: cow_bell, chime, flute, bell (soul sand/packed ice/clay/gold)
* Facing East: didgeridoo, pling, banjo, bit (pumpkin/glowstone/hay/emerald)

Build: `make note_guide.zip`

=== Brew Guide


Adds a simple cheat sheet to the brewing stand GUI to remind you how potions are made.

image::https://i.imgur.com/edmhYeq.png[Brew Guide]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make brew_guide.zip`

=== Tech Arrows

Adds arrows to the top of hoppers and the side of observers so that you can
see which direction they're pointing. The observer's arrows light up when they
activate so that you can see signals passing through them.

//image::https://i.imgur.com/RwOzhsR.png[Tech Arrows]
image::https://i.imgur.com/EyBG6cG.png[Tech Arrows]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

=== Villager Mech

Turns iron golems into mechsuit-wearing villagers.

image::https://i.imgur.com/oF0MLK9.png[Village Mech]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make villager_mech.zip`

=== Pig Armor

Adds iron armor to saddled pigs.

image::https://i.imgur.com/KA4glG4.png[Pig Armor]

This is an aesthetic change only,
it doesn't reduce the damage that pigs take.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make pig_armor.zip`

=== Ravager

Moves the ravager's eyes to the side of its face.

image::https://i.imgur.com/bJEeUdc.png[Ravager]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make ravager.zip`

=== Ore Types

Mixes classic ore textures with the modern ones introduced in 1.17 to provide
more variety in ore shapes.
Nether and deepslate ores are left unchanged, while stone ores use a simple,
classic-inspired aesthetic that pairs well with stone's clean texture.

//image::https://i.imgur.com/kXCHAdS.png[Ore Types]
image::https://i.imgur.com/G4xb3Q7.png[Ore Types]

Rather than simply reverting the stone ores to their 1.16 version,
this pack organizes them into "types" that determine the ore's shape.

* "Metallic" ores (Copper, Iron, Gold) are shaped like classic iron ore
* "Gemlike" ores (Redstone, Diamond, Emerald) use the old emerald shape
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) are shaped like modern coal ore

As an originally unintended bonus,
gemlike ores stick up one pixel above lava,
so you can find them a bit more easily.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make ore_types.zip`

=== Discreet Pumpkin

Makes the pumpkin helmet gui less obtrusive.

Lets you climb chains and bamboo.

image::https://i.imgur.com/4yukdfV.png[Climbable]

Note that you need to be in the same block space as the block you're climbing.
Since bamboo is randomly offset from the center of the block it's in,
some bamboo shoots will have one or two sides that aren't climbable.

pumpkins, beehives, and bee nests.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make shearless.zip`

=== Gardener Endermen

Makes it so that endermen can't pick up blocks such as dirt and grass blocks,
and can pick up more plants and fungi.

All the blocks that endermen can pick up are listed
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/enderman_holdable.json[here].

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

=== Loot Overhaul

Overhauls the vanilla loot tables to make early-to-midgame exploration more
exciting. Many, though not all, of the loot changes are described below.

Saddles, horse armor, nametags and leads are craftable and removed from the
loot tables to make room for other loot. This is to avoid changing the rarity
of some entries like ore ingots. Nearly all loot table entries added by this
pack are replacements for the entries that it removes.

Bonus spawn chests generate a more limited and curated set of starter items
designed to jumpstart the tree-punching phase of a fresh world:
3-5 cobble, 2-3 bread, and 3-5 logs. Additional items can be added to the
bonus spawn chest with one or more of the <<starter-item,Starter Item>>
datapacks below.

Food loot is themed according to the structure it spawns in.
To give a few examples:
Underground structures have potatoes and carrots.
Villager and illager structures have pie, cookies, and cake.
Ocean chests have salmon and cod.
Desert and jungle temples occasionally have honey.

More chests spawn music discs, and it's possible to find every music disc in a
chest instead of just Cat and 13.

Some chests have custom explorer maps that lead to other structures. For
example, Woodland Mansion chests have a chance to spawn a Reconnaissance Map
that leads to a Pillager Outpost, and the chest in the outpost has a chance to
spawn a Swamp Exploration Map that leads to a Witch Hut. Maps found in Nether
Fortresses lead to Piglin Bastions, and vice versa. End City chests have a
chance to spawn a map leading to another End City. Maps leading to Jungle
Temples can generate in Stronghold Libraries. And so on.

End Cities generate only diamond gear rather than a mix of diamond and iron,
and Woodland Mansions can rarely generate a conduit, beacon, or shulker box.

Instead of generating seeds, End Cities and Woodland Mansions generate plant
resources that you haven't used yet. Such resources include everything from
berries, wheat seeds and potatoes to cactus, bamboo, and rose bushes. If you
haven't eaten, planted, or otherwise used one of the items shown below, you
have a chance to find it in End City and Woodland Mansion chests.

image::https://i.imgur.com/gUnJW5S.png[Treasure Seeds]


Enchanted books in most loot tables spawn with a 50% chance to be enchanted
with multiple enchants instead of a single random enchant. Enchanted
books found in libraries and map rooms have the other 50% spawn as a
treasure enchant instead of a single random enchant.

The soul speed books and gear normally found in nether chests have a
random treasure enchant instead. More nether chests have such books. Note that
books obtained through bartering still generate with Soul Speed 100% of the
time.

Most armor & tools are enchanted at an enchantment level determined by the
area the structure spawns in. Aboveground structures have gear enchanted at
levels 15-20, underground and ocean structures at levels 20-25, nether
structures at levels 25-30, and end structures at levels 25-39.

=== Artifact Loot

This is an addon pack for the
<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
datapack above. It adds artifact items to the loot tables that spawn with a one
in a thousand chance in chests and a one in a million chance from fishing.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make artifact_loot.zip`

=== Starter Item

This is a series of addon datapacks for the
<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
pack above. Each pack adds one additional item to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Bed adds a Red Bed to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Book adds a Book & Quill to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Bucket adds a Bucket to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Map adds a Map to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Shulker adds a Shulker Box to the bonus spawn chest.

If multiple Starter Item packs are installed, the bonus chest will spawn one
starter item chosen at random. To make it spawn *all* starter items, edit
`loot_overhaul.zip/data/minecraft/loot_tables/chests/spawn_bonus_chest.json`
and change the `expand` line in the `starter` tag entry so that it says
`true` instead of `false`:

 "expand": true

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build:

 make starter_bed.zip
 make starter_book.zip
 make starter_bucket.zip
 make starter_map.zip
 make starter_shulker.zip

=== More Shulker Shells

Makes shulkers drop 0-2 shells. Looting decreases your chance of getting zero
shells.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make more_shulker_shells.zip`

=== Escape the Nether

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in the Nether.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the wither.
Until you do that, you'll respawn in the Nether in a cage made of fungus and
netherbrick.

//image::[Escape the Nether]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make escape_nether.zip`

=== Escape the End

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in The End.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the dragon and obtain
elytra -- but not necessarily in that order. Until you do those two things,
you'll respawn on The End platform with slimestone materials in your inventory
that you can use to travel to the outer end islands.

//image::[Escape the End]

If you want to use this pack and Escape the Nether to play minecraft in
reverse, i.e. if you want to beat The End to gain access to the Nether and
then beat the Nether to gain access to the overworld, install them both in the
usual way and then run these commands:

    /datapack disable "file/escape_end.zip"
    /datapack enable "file/escape_end.zip" after "file/escape_nether.zip"

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make escape_end.zip`

=== Escape the Grind

The two data packs above, Escape the Nether and Escape the End, provide a
survival experience outside the overworld with a bare minimum of
additions to make the game still playable. Part of the challenge is
that normal parts of the game aren't available to you. For example, ranged
combat is not possible using only materials found in The End, and enchanting
isn't possible using only materials found in the Nether.

Escape the Grind is a 1.16.x addon data pack that's designed to reduce the grind of,
and add possibilities to, a Nether-only or End-only survival experience.

Changes that facilitate survival in Nether:

* You're given a saddle and a mushroom on a stick whenever you respawn
* Grindstones can be crafted using a polished blackstone slab
* There's a chance that crying obsidian will drop lapis when broken

Changes that facilitate survival in The End:

* In addition to slimestone materials, you're given TNT whenever you respawn
* While holding ender pearls in both your main hand and offhand, purple
  particles indicate you're looking in the direction of an end city and sandy
  particles indicate you're looking within 90 degrees of one
* End city loot includes fireworks and enchanted crossbows

Build: `make escape_grind.zip`

=== Hardcore Lichdom

Hardcore Lichdom is a 1.16.x challenge datapack designed for hardcore mode.  With
this pack, players who conquer the Illagers, the Ocean, the Wither, and The
End without dying can gain immortality and keep their world forever.
Advancements document the basics of the data pack. For more comprehensive
documentation, read on.

When you die in minecraft hardcore mode you are given the
option to spectate the world as a ghost. If you use rare materials to perform
the proper rituals, you can cheat death and become a lich, a powerful
undead that can use a phylactery pedestal to regenerate your body and restore
your ghost form to life.

To become a lich, you will need:

* Totem of Undying
* Dry Sponge
* Trident with Loyalty III
* Cauldron
* Dragon Head
* Beacon

image::https://i.imgur.com/dxgHI3n.png[Hardcore Lichdom]

Make sure the cauldron has water in it, then throw the totem, sponge, and
loyalty trident in to turn the totem into a phylactery. Place the dragon head
on top of the beacon, then throw the phylactery on top of the dragon head to
create a phylactery pedestal.

image::https://i.imgur.com/a04jraC.png[Phylactery Pedestal]

Choose the location for your phylactery pedestal carefully with the following
in mind:

* The pedestal block can't be moved or destroyed once created
* The phylactery item can't despawn or be picked up, but it's otherwise a
  normal item that can be destroyed by fire and explosions
* You may want to shield the phylactery pedestal from the sun so you aren't
  affected by its debilitating effects when you respawn (see below)

Once the phylactery pedestal is built, you will need a magic user's help to
become a lich. Simply convince a witch to kill you with magic damage, and
lichdom is yours. Once the witch kills you, your ghost form will be able to
obtain a new body at the phylactery pedestal.

Lichdom has the following consequences and benefits:

* Direct sunlight poisons you
* Undead won't attack you
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must steal necromantic energy from other undead by
  damaging them
* Some animals transform when they're near you -- bats become vampiric,
  rabbits become rabid, and turtles become more turtley

In addition, as a lich you can gain different sets of abilities, called
"forms", by killing certain animals. The animal forms available to you are
described below, and replace the lich powers described above. To revert to
lich form, you can either kill a villager or die and regenerate your body at a
pedestal.

**Form of the Vampire**: Kill a bat to obtain this form

* Wings burst from your back, destroying anything in your chestplate slot
* Direct sunlight withers you
* You have Night Vision and Regeneration
* Undead won't attack you unless they're under the power of a lich
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must drink blood from creatures by damaging them
* Bats become vampiric when they're near you

**Form of the Werebunny**: Kill a rabbit to obtain this form

* Your body grows fur and powerful muscles, destroying anything in your
  chestplate slot
* Direct moonlight increases your speed and makes you ravenously hungry
* You have Strength and Jump Boost II
* You can eat only carrots and raw meat for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Rabbits become rabid when they're near you

**Form of the Turtle**: Kill a turtle to obtain this form

* You grow a turtle shell, destroying anything in your helmet slot
* You die if your shell breaks
* You have Slowness, Dolphin's Grace, and Resistance III
* You can eat only dried kelp for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Turtles become more turtley when they're near you

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make lichdom.zip`

Known Issues:

* This pack uses teams and is incompatible with other data packs that use
  teams
* Sunlight and moonlight affect players even when it's raining or snowing
  because Java edition does not have a `/weather query` command
* Food that rots will always produce either two rotten flesh or one
  poisonous potato because preserving stack sizes with `/replaceitem` is only
  possible with hacky shulker box workarounds
* If a player in turtle form dies from their shell breaking, other players who
  die in the same tick will have their death messages suppressed

TO DO AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=============================

Merge loot table changes with Loot Overhaul
Add new plants to Gardener Endermen and Shearless packs
Add new ores to Ore Types
Add new End blocks to Dragonproof
Add new potions to Brewing Guide

HOW TO UPDATE LOOT TABLES AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=================================================

Extract the necessary folders from the new jar

 mkdir 1.17
 cd 1.17
 jar xf ~/.minecraft/versions/1.17/1.17.jar assets data
 cd ..

Copy new loot tables to orig.new folder

 mkdir data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new
 rsync -av 1.17.jar/data/minecraft/loot_tables/{gameplay,chests} data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new/
 cd data/minecraft/loot_tables

Convert the original tables from YAML to JSON

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +

Compare the new and old tables using diff

 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -

If diff complains about newlines, append newlines to the new tables

 find orig.new/ -name \*.json | while read file; do echo >> "$file"; done

Edit the loot table template or what-have-you to update whatever formatting
changes Mojang made to the JSON

 vim loot_table.j2 

Repeat important steps as necessary

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +
 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -
 vim loot_table.j2 

Commit changes in the usual way
