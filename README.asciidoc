=== Note Guide

Adds a display to the top of note blocks that shows the note it's tuned to
and its position on a keyboard.

image::https://i.imgur.com/Nb8e9mn.png[Note Guide]

Unfortunately, note blocks don't have an orientation, so in this texture pack,
the direction they face depends on the instrument it's set to, i.e. the
block underneath:

* Facing West: bass, snare, hat, basedrum (wood/sand/glass/stone)
* Facing North: harp, guitar, iron_xylophone, xylophone (dirt/wool/iron/bone)
* Facing South: cow_bell, chime, flute, bell (soul sand/packed ice/clay/gold)
* Facing East: didgeridoo, pling, banjo, bit (pumpkin/glowstone/hay/emerald)

see which direction they're pointing. The observer's arrows light up when they
activate so that you can see signals passing through them.

saddling a pig gives it 4 armor defense points
(the same amount that an iron helmet and boots provide to players).

=== Ore Types

Mixes classic ore textures with the modern ones introduced in 1.17.
Nether and deepslate ores are left unchanged, while stone ores use a simple,
classic-inspired aesthetic.

image::https://i.imgur.com/G4xb3Q7.png[Ore Types]

Rather than simply reverting the stone ores to their 1.16 version,
this pack organizes them into "types" that determine the ore's shape.

* "Metallic" ores (Copper, Iron, Gold) are shaped like classic iron ore
* "Gemlike" ores (Redstone, Diamond, Emerald) use the old emerald shape
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) are shaped like modern coal ore

== Tag Data Packs

These are simple yet powerful commandless data packs that work by modifying
https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tag[tags]
in the vanilla game.
They shouldn't add any lag to your game.

=== Enchanting

Makes more blocks work with the enchantment table.
Chiseled bookshelves power the enchantment table,
and
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/enchantment_power_transmitter.json[these blocks]
don't block bookshelves from boosting the enchantment table.

=== Mineable

In vanilla Minecraft, certain blocks like glass have no tool associated with
them, so their breaking speed is the same whether you're using your fist or a
tool or an Efficiency tool. This pack gives more blocks an associated tool.

The blocks that are given an associated tool are listed here:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/pickaxe.json.sempl[Pick]
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/data/minecraft/tags/blocks/mineable/axe.json[Axe]

In addition,
pickaxes are no longer the associated tool for spawners or budding amethyst,
so that it's more difficult to accidentally break these blocks.

This pack fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-199752[MC-199752].

== Loot Data Packs

These data packs work by modifying loot tables in the vanilla game.
They shouldn't add any lag to your game.

=== Shearless

Makes hoes able to harvest blocks that are normally obtained with shears.
In addition, hoes harvest bamboo saplings faster than normal,
and grass drops dead bushes when harvested
with a hoe or shears in badlands biomes.

image::https://i.imgur.com/7tN7Zij.png[Shearless]

Note that shears are still required to shear sheep, mooshroom, snow golems,
pumpkins, beehives, and bee nests.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the
loot tables of the blocks shown above.

=== Husbandry

Adds more farmable drops.

Crops drop more wheat or beetroots when harvested with Fortune,
and the seeds of these crops drop at a flat rate of 0-3 regardless of
Fortune level.

Goats drop mutton.

The drop rate of jungle saplings is slightly increased when harvested with
Fortune, to a maximum of 5% with Fortune III.

Shulkers have a chance to drop 2 shulker shells when killed with Looting.
With Looting III, there is a 50% chance to drop 1 shell and a 50% chance to
drop 2 shells.

=== No Treasure Maps

Removes buried treasure maps in shipwrecks. There is a
1/3 chance for the map chest to have a barrel containing buried
treasure loot instead.

image::https://i.imgur.com/ZHAbtU9.png[Treasure Barrel]

This is a workaround for
https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-218156[MC-218156],
which can affect challenge maps such as
https://github.com/dmbuce/badlands-challenge#the-badlands-challenge[The Badlands Challenge]
or even default worldgen.

See <<treasure-barrels,Treasure Barrels>> for a version of this pack that's
compatible with <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>.

=== Heads

Below is a series of datapacks that adds decorative player heads to the game.

==== Fae Heads

Adds fae such as dwarves, goblins, elves, gnomes, and gremlins.
These fae are mysterious creatures
that transform into a block whenever a player is near.
The transformation renders them indistinguishible from normal blocks,
making it impossible for players to identify them.

image::https://i.imgur.com/LoLenEF.png[Fae]

Shown above is a coal dwarf, a birch elf, a plains gnome, a cobble goblin,
and a TNT gremlin

Their only natural predators are cats, who hunt them at night.
When a tamed cat sleeps with a player in a bed,
it has a chance to give its owner a fae head as a gift in the morning.
These heads replace raw chicken in the cat gift loot table
and look like tiny blocks.

==== Golem Heads

Makes villagers give golem heads as gifts to a player with Hero of the Village
instead of their normal gifts.
The heads look like tiny blocks and are a vestige of a time long gone,
when villagers could create golems out of materials other than iron.

// To create a golem with the head, place it on an armor stand.
// The golem can't move, but can display armor and scare crows away.

==== Player Heads

Makes players drop their head when killed
by a player, dragon, wither, elder guardian, ravager, or polar bear.

When a warden kills a player, it captures that player's soul
and releases the soul of one of The Ancients.
The head of that Ancient is dropped instead of the player's.

=== Loot Overhaul

Overhauls the vanilla loot tables to make early-to-midgame exploration more
exciting. Many, though not all, of the loot changes are described below.

Saddles, nametags, horse armor, and snout banner patterns are craftable
using the same recipes as the <<loot-crafting,Loot Crafting>> datapack.
These items and leads are removed from the loot tables
to make room for other loot.
This is to avoid changing the rarity of some entries like ore ingots.
Nearly all loot table entries added by this pack are replacements
for the entries that it removes.

Bonus spawn chests generate a more limited and curated set of starter items
designed to jumpstart the tree-punching phase of a fresh world:
3-5 cobble, 3-5 logs, and 2-3 bread. Additional items can be added to the
bonus spawn chest with one or more <<starter-item,Starter Item>>
datapacks, or the <<starter-relic,Starter Relic>> datapack.

Food loot is themed according to the structure it spawns in.
To give a few examples:
Underground structures have potatoes and carrots.
Villager and illager structures have pie, cookies, and cake.
Ocean chests have salmon and cod.
Desert and jungle temples occasionally have honey.

More chests spawn music discs, and it's possible to find every music disc in a
chest instead of just Cat and 13.

Copper generates alongside other ores in some chests.

Some chests have custom explorer maps that lead to other structures.
For example, Woodland Mansion chests have a chance to spawn
a Reconnaissance Map that leads to a Pillager Outpost,
and the chest in the outpost has a chance to spawn
a Swamp Exploration Map that leads to a Witch Hut.
Maps found in Nether Fortresses lead to Piglin Bastions, and vice versa.
End City chests have a chance to spawn a map leading to another End City.
Maps leading to Jungle Temples can generate in Stronghold Libraries.
Ancient Cities, Stronghold Libraries, Dungeons,
and Big Underwater Ruins can have maps that lead to Ancient Cities.
And so on.

End Cities generate only diamond gear rather than a mix of diamond and iron,
and Woodland Mansions can rarely generate a conduit, beacon, or shulker box.

Enchanted books in most loot tables spawn with a 50% chance to be enchanted
with multiple enchants instead of a single random enchant. Enchanted
books found in libraries and map rooms have the other 50% spawn as a
treasure enchant instead of a single random enchant.

The soul speed books and gear normally found in nether chests have a
random treasure enchant instead. More nether chests have such books. Note that
books obtained through bartering still generate with Soul Speed 100% of the
time.

Most armor & tools are enchanted at an enchantment level determined by the
area the structure spawns in.
Aboveground structures have gear enchanted at levels 15-19,
underground and ocean structures at levels 20-24,
nether structures at levels 25-29,
woodland mansion and end structures at levels 30-39,
and ancient cities at levels 40-49.

Some unobtainable blocks can rarely be found in loot. In addition to the
tall grass and large ferns that normally generate in savannah and taiga village
chests, path blocks generate in snowy village chests, farmland in desert
village chests, and petrified oak slabs in plains village chests. Petrified
slabs also generate in dungeons. Infested bricks spawn in stronghold chests,
and a single reinforced deepslate rarely spawns in ancient cities.
Light blocks spawn in woodland mansion and ancient city chests,
and have a custom texture if you have the
<<spellsmithing-guide,Spellsmithing Guide>> resource pack installed.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the chest,
fishing, or bartering loot tables.

Treasure seeds are plant resources that you haven't used yet.
Such resources include everything from berries, wheat seeds and potatoes
to cactus, bamboo, and rose bushes. If you haven't eaten, planted,
or otherwise used one of the items shown below, you
have a chance to find it in End City and Woodland Mansion chests.

== Trigger Data Packs

These data packs include advancement triggers
that run commands when certain conditions are met.

When a player places a hopper against a note block,
allays within 16 blocks of the player that are assigned to a note block
become permanently assigned to their note block.

you can break the note block,
reassign it to its note block,
or assign it to a new note block.

the rate of growth and decay for many natural processes is increased.
Examples of such processes include
plant growth, leaf decay, fire growth, and ice melting.

Once the dragon has been defeated,
players stop losing their items when they die,
and lose all experience when they die.
The XP does not drop as orbs.

If the warden is defeated, provoked neutral mobs become angrier.
They will attack players other than the one who angered them
and will continue to attack even if the player they're angry at is dead.

the illusioner drops leather enchanted with Myth of Cloaking,
a custom enchantment that can be applied to elytra in the smithing table.
When a player wearing the elytra is hit by a mob, they gain 8 minutes of
invisibility. The invisibility ends if the player damages a mob.

circumstances described below.

.Click for a summary of mythic relics
[%collapsible]
====

**Relic of the Beast**: When a player hits a white rabbit with raw cod, it
turns into a Killer Bunny. If killed with raw cod, the Killer
Bunny drops a rabbit's foot with Myth of Bounding, a
custom enchantment that can be applied to leather boots in the smithing
table. When a player
wearing the boots falls 3.5 blocks, eats a carrot, or eats rabbit, they gain
Speed II and Jump Boost II for 90 seconds.

**Relic of Poles**: When an iron golem is killed by a charged creeper, it
drops a compass with Myth of Magnetism, a custom enchantment that can be
applied to a shield in the smithing table. A player blocking with the shield
attracts the nearest item. A player that sneaks while blocking with the shield
attracts all nearby items.

**Relic of the Flying Pig**: When a pig with Levitation dies,
it drops a porkchop with Myth of Hovering,
a custom enchantment that can be applied
to a chainmail chestplate in the smithing table.
When a player wearing the chestplate eats cooked or raw porkchop,
they gain Levitation II and Slowness II for 10 seconds,
and saddling a pig while wearing the chestplate makes it hover.

**Relic of Rainbows**: When a
https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sheep#Easter_eggs[rainbow sheep]
dies from an explosion,
it drops pink dye with Myth of Chromatic Blasts,
a custom enchantment that can be applied to a crossbow in the smithing table.
Rockets shot with the crossbow gain two randomly generated firework stars.

**Relic of Mining**: Deepslate Emerald Ore drops a gold nugget with Myth of
Darkvision and Myth of Greed, two custom enchantments that can be applied to
a golden helmet in the smithing table. Myth of Darkvision provides eight minutes
of Night Vision when a player tills soil with a hoe,
creates a path with a shovel, or strips a log with an axe.
Myth of Greed charges every time a player's pickaxe loses durability.
At 250 charge, the enchantment provides one minute of Haste I,
and the charge resets.

**Relic of the Lens**: When a player with 1 health (i.e. half a heart) kills an
endermite in melee, it drops an amethyst shard with Myth of Seeking, a
custom enchantment that can be applied to a spyglass in the smithing table.
A player can use the spyglass to pinpoint the direction of the nearest
Woodland Mansion, Nether Fortress, or End City.

**Relic of Storms**: If the <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> datapack is
installed before this one, hearts of the sea in buried treasure chests have Myth of
Stormcalling, a custom enchantment that can be applied to a trident in the
smithing table. A player can summon rain with the trident
by standing in water, looking skyward, and holding right click for several
seconds.

**Relic of Glowing**: When a frog eats a glow squid,
it drops glow ink with Myth of Lightning Bug,
a custom enchantment that can be applied to a trident in the smithing table.
When the trident is thrown and hits a mob,
it creates a Light block if there's space to do so.

**Relic of the Rodeo Clown**: When a frog eats a bee,
it drops a belt buckle with Myth of the Lasso and Myth of Balloon Animals,
two custom enchantments that can be applied to leather pants in the smithing
table. When a player wearing the pants hits one of
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/buce-data/mythic/leashing/leashable.entity_type.tag.json[these mobs]
with a lead, the lead attaches to the mob.
When a player wearing the pants right clicks a lead on one of
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMBuce/bucepack/master/buce-data/mythic/balloons/balloons.entity_type.tag.json[these creatures],
it gains levitation until a player unleashes it or it reaches y=350.

**Relic of Quicksilver**: When an iron golem kills a ghast, it drops a bead of
quicksilver with Sharpness V and Myth of Liquid Metal, a custom enchantment
that can be applied to an iron sword in the smithing table. When placed in the
offhand, the sword transforms into a shield with Unbreaking III. When
placed in the main hand or dealing damage, it transforms back into its
sword form. Transforming resets all properties of the item including its
durability, enchantments, name, and banner pattern.

**Relic of the Burrower**: When a player kills a silverfish in melee without a
weapon, it drops a silverfish eye with Myth of Breaking, a custom
enchantment that can be applied to a diamond pick, axe, shovel, or hoe in the
smithing table. When a block broken by the tool drops an item and decreases the
tool's durability, the tool will break several extra blocks.
Picks break a 3x3 square, axes break a 32-block-high column,
shovels break a 9-block column, and hoes break a 3x3x3 sphere.
The extra broken blocks are not affected by fortune or silk touch and do not
further decrease the tool's durability.

// some things to note about Breaking, Silk Touch, and Fortune
//
// getting a mix of drops for ores and stone is really annoying with
// silk touch + breaking
//
// fortune axes only work on melons
//
// fortune shovels only work on gravel
//
// silk hoes and fortune hoes are both useful for leaves
//
// so my preferred tool loadout is:
// * picks: fortune + breaking, silk touch + unbreaking
// * axe: silk touch + breaking
// * shovel: silk touch + breaking
// * hoe: fortune, silk touch, not sure about breaking vs unbreaking on them

**Relic of Echoes**: If the <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> datapack is
installed before this one, some echo shards in ancient city chests have Myth of
Reverberation, a custom enchantment that can be applied to a totem in the
smithing table. When the totem is used, another totem from the player's
inventory is placed in their hand if one is available, and it's given the same
enchantments. Then, there's a chance that an echo shard is created from
the totem's reverberations.

//**Relic of the Void**: If the <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> datapack is
//installed before this one, some echo shards in ancient city chests have Myth of
//Reflection, a custom enchantment that can be applied to a totem in the
//smithing table. When a player holding the totem takes damage in the void,

which provide access to some of the relics.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the
Pig, Silverfish, Endermite, Ghast, Iron Golem, or Deepslate Emerald Ore
loot tables.

Known Issues:
Myth of Seeking can behave in unexpected ways
due to https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-138887[MC-138887].

=== Phantasmal

// Phantoms were so close to being a good addition,
// yet somehow missed the mark.
// I think they would have been better received
// if their drops were a bit more useful
// and fighting them was a bit more interesting.
// I have a [couple datapacks](https://github.com/dmbuce/bucepack#phantasmal)
// that do that by giving phantoms some invisibility-related abilities
// and making their drops a crafting component for
// invisible item frames and light blocks.
// Playing with the packs has turned phantoms
// from a nuisance into a welcome distraction.

Makes phantoms more phantasmal.

When a phantom hits a player, its body turns invisible, and only its eyes and
a faint trail of smoke coming off its wingtips can be seen.

When an invisible phantom hits a player, it disappears with a shriek in a puff
of smoke.

When a player hits a phantom, it turns visible.

All the above effects only apply to phantoms in the overworld.

Phantom membranes dropped by phantoms have Glamer of Invisibility,
an enchantment that can be applied to an item frame or glow item frame
in the smithing table to make an invisible item frame.
It can also be applied to a torch in the smithing table
to make an invisible light block.
// the light block is one light level higher than a torch because the stick,
// when invisible, does not cast a shadow

While holding an item frame,
a glass particle effect indicates
the position of nearby invisible item frames.

image::https://i.imgur.com/qR2I580.png[Phantasmal]

If the <<fae-heads,Fae Heads>> datapack is
installed before this one,
phantom membranes from cat gifts have Glamer of Invisibility as well.

If you have the <<spellsmithing-guide,Spellsmithing Guide>> resource pack
installed, invisible item frames will
have a translucent item texture in the inventory,
and invisible light items will have a custom texture.

This pack is a companion to the <<phantasmal-end,Phantasmal End>> datapack,
which adds phantoms to the dragon fight.

Known Issues: The Glamer of Invisibility can't be applied to armor stands
because of https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-66068[MC-66068],
a works-as-intended bug that prevents invisible armor stands from being broken.
// just because mojang says it's a bug doesn't mean i have to agree with them
// i think it's a bug

=== Phantasmal End

Adds phantoms to the dragon fight.

Whenever a player damages the dragon, each end crystal summons a phantom.

When a player hits a phantom, it turns invisible,
and only its eyes and a faint trail of smoke coming off its wingtips can
be seen.

When a phantom hits a player, it turns visible.

All the above effects only apply to phantoms in The End.

Phantasmal End is a companion pack to the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>> datapack,
which makes phantoms in the Overworld more incorporeal and lets you craft
invisible item frames and light blocks with phantom membranes.

//Relic of Harmony:
//When a player kills a Warden, it drops a sculk catalyst with
//Myth of Deep Gates, a custom enchantment that can be applied to
//a goat horn in the smithing table.
//Playing the horn at the center of an ancient city transports the player to the world's surface.
//Playing the horn on a mountaintop transports the player back to the last
//ancient city the player played the horn at.

=== Deep Gate Network

Turns the reinforced deepslate structures at the center of ancient cities
into _deep gates_ in a network that spans the overworld.
Deep gates resonate with and amplify the melody of loud instruments.
A deep gate that detects such a melody echoing through the mountaintops
or playing nearby can transport a player far and wide.

Playing a goat horn near a deep gate transports the player
to the world's surface.

Playing a goat horn on a mountain peak transports the player back
to the last deep gate that horn was played at.

//The transportation effect requires standing on one of [these blocks] to work.

=== Nether Portal Network

Limits nether travel to ruined portals.

With this datapack, there is a nexus near each ruined portal
that weakens the fabric of reality between the overworld and nether.
If a player tries to use a nether portal that's too far away from a nexus,
the portal will break.

//Nexuses near overworld ruined portals provide a 204 block radius area in the
//overworld and a 25.5 block radius area in the nether where portals work.
//Nexuses near nether ruined portals provide a 362 block radius area in the
//overworld and a 46 block radius area in the nether where portals work.

Nether portal mechanics are unchanged for entities other than players.

=== Storage Orbs

Lets you stack shulker boxes with the same contents in orb form.

Store a shulker box in an eye of ender
by combining them in the smithing table.
Any dye on the box is destroyed,
but its contents and name are preserved in the eye.
Right clicking the orb restores the shulker box and destroys the eye.

== Data Resource Packs

These packs can be installed as a resource pack, a data pack, or both.

Due to limitations in data/resource pack versioning,
these packs will display a false incompatibility warning
when installed as a datapack in the "Create New World" screen.
If you grabbed the correct version of the pack from the
https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases[Releases] page,
you can safely ignore this warning.

=== Copper Overhaul

Incorporates copper throughout the game's progression.

Stone tools are reskinned as copper tools.
Wood tools are reskinned as stone tools
and can be crafted with flint in addition to cobblestone.

Chainmail armor is reskinned as copper armor
and some iron armor is reskinned as chainmail.

image::https://i.imgur.com/wdWOFyJ.png[Copper Overhaul]

Iron doors, iron trapdoors, gold pressure plates, and blackstone buttons
are replaced with copper variants.

Tripwire hooks are crafted with copper instead of iron,
and the dispenser recipe uses tripwire hooks instead of bows.
Copper is used to craft detector rails,
and all rail recipes are adjusted to have a stick in the middle.

image::https://i.imgur.com/IeJHUPu.png[Copper Overhaul]

Partial support is provided for renaming
wooden and stone tools, chainmail and iron armor,
iron doors and trapdoors, and blackstone buttons.
See <<language-support,Language Support>> for details.

== Challenge Data Packs

Data packs that create new ways to play Minecraft.

=== Escape the Nether

A survival challenge that starts you in the Nether.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the wither.
Until you do that,
you'll respawn in the Nether in a cage made of fungus and netherbrick.

=== Escape the End

A survival challenge that starts you in The End.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the dragon and obtain
elytra -- but not necessarily in that order. Until you do those two things,
you'll respawn on The End platform with slimestone materials in your inventory
that you can use to travel to the outer end islands.

//image::[Escape the End]

This datapack is compatible with <<escape-the-nether,Escape the Nether>>.
If both are installed, you will play minecraft in reverse,
i.e. you will have to defeat The End to gain access to the Nether
and then defeat the Nether to gain access to the overworld.

=== Escape the Grind

The two data packs above, Escape the Nether and Escape the End, provide a
survival experience outside the overworld with a bare minimum of
additions to make the game still playable. Part of the challenge is
that normal parts of the game aren't available to you. For example, ranged
combat is not possible using only materials found in The End, and enchanting
isn't possible using only materials found in the Nether.

Escape the Grind is an addon data pack that's designed to reduce the grind of,
and add possibilities to, a Nether-only or End-only survival experience.

Changes that facilitate survival in the Nether:

* You're given a saddle and a mushroom on a stick when you respawn in the
  Nether
* Grindstones can be crafted using a polished blackstone slab
* There's a chance that crying obsidian will drop lapis when broken

Changes that facilitate survival in The End:

* In addition to slimestone materials, you're given TNT when you respawn in
  The End
* You can obtain the Relic of the Lens from <<mythic-relics,Mythic Relics>>
* End cities include loot from <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
  and <<treasure-seeds,Treasure Seeds>>,
  including enchanted crossbows to use as a ranged weapon, fireworks for ammo,
  plus copper and warped stems to craft the Relic of the Lens with

== WorldGen Data Packs

These packs rely on experimental worldgen features.

=== DripBlock

If you create a Default or Large Biomes world with this datapack installed,
it generates a skyblock overworld with a small spawn island at 0, 0.
The only available resources at first are dripstone, water, and glow berries.
A cauldron on the island provides access to lava later on.

image::https://i.imgur.com/t66BrqO.png[DripBlock]

Several changes enable survival skyblock gameplay:

* Dripstone farming is made faster by setting `randomTickSpeed` to 500
* Creepers drop moss when killed by a player, and moss spreads to dripstone
* Grass blocks can be crafted from 4 dirt blocks and 2 moss carpet
* Buckets can be crafted from iron nuggets instead of ingots

Several companion packs are available to enhance your DripBlock experience.
<<wandering-loot,Wandering Loot>> gives access to The End
and loot found in structure chests,
<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> makes the loot in those chests more exciting,
<<treasure-seeds,Treasure Seeds>>
makes certain resources obtainable through said loot,
and <<hover-mode,Hover Mode>> adds basic flight.

== Legacy Data Packs

These data packs haven't been updated for the most recent version of
Minecraft.
They also all happen to access NBT data a lot and run commands every tick,
which means they're not optimized very well yet.
Lower end devices might have trouble running them.

=== Hardcore Lichdom

Hardcore Lichdom is a 1.16.x challenge datapack designed for hardcore mode.  With
this pack, players who conquer the Illagers, the Ocean, the Wither, and The
End without dying can gain immortality and keep their world forever.
Advancements document the basics of the data pack. For more comprehensive
documentation, read on.

When you die in minecraft hardcore mode you are given the
option to spectate the world as a ghost. If you use rare materials to perform
the proper rituals, you can cheat death and become a lich, a powerful
undead that can use a phylactery pedestal to regenerate your body and restore
your ghost form to life.

//
//Becoming a lich is a multi-step process.
//
//**Use magic to defeat magic**
//
//The rites of lichdom appear whenever one skilled mage defeats another.
//If you kill an evoker with a harming potion,
//it will drop the Relic of Rites, a tome enchanted with
// // Curse of Vanishing and
//Myth of Lichdom.
//When used, the knowledge gained from this tome
//gives you the ability to become a lich
//and reveals the rest of the required steps in your advancements.
//
//**Slay the dragon while wearing its grin**
//
//Bind the dragon's power to you.
//If you kill the dragon while wearing a dragon head,
//the head is transformed into the Relic of Draconic Might,
//gaining Power X
// //, Curse of Binding,
//and Boon of the Dragon,
//a custom enchantment that increases your max health by 10 hearts.
//
//**Channel the sea's elders**
//
//Obtain a vessel for your soul.
//If you channel lightning on an elder guardian and then kill it,
//it will drop a Relic of the Empty Vessel with Myth of the Phylactery.
//
//**Use spellsmithing to create a phylactery**
//
//Combine the Relic of the Empty Vessel with a totem, a star, or a sword.
//That is, create a phylactery by combining the relic with a totem of undying,
//a nether star, or a netherite sword.
//
//**Harness the effects of a wither**

To become a lich, you will need:

* Totem of Undying
* Dry Sponge
* Trident with Loyalty III
* Cauldron
* Dragon Head
* Beacon

Make sure the cauldron has water in it, then throw the totem, sponge, and
loyalty trident in to turn the totem into a phylactery. Place the dragon head
on top of the beacon, then throw the phylactery on top of the dragon head to
create a phylactery pedestal.

image::https://i.imgur.com/a04jraC.png[Phylactery Pedestal]

Choose the location for your phylactery pedestal carefully with the following
in mind:

* The pedestal block can't be moved or destroyed once created
* The phylactery item can't despawn or be picked up, but it's otherwise a
  normal item that can be destroyed by fire and explosions
* You may want to shield the phylactery pedestal from the sun so you aren't
  affected by its debilitating effects when you respawn (see below)

Once the phylactery pedestal is built, you will need a magic user's help to
become a lich. Simply convince a witch to kill you with magic damage, and
lichdom is yours. Once the witch kills you, your ghost form will be able to
obtain a new body at the phylactery pedestal.

Lichdom has the following consequences and benefits:

* Direct sunlight poisons you
* Undead won't attack you
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must steal necromantic energy from other undead by
  damaging them
* Some animals transform when they're near you -- bats become vampiric,
  rabbits become rabid, and turtles become more turtley

In addition, as a lich you can gain different sets of abilities, called
"forms", by killing certain animals. The animal forms available to you are
described below, and replace the lich powers described above. To revert to
lich form, you can either kill a villager or die and regenerate your body at a
pedestal.

**Form of the Vampire**: Kill a bat to obtain this form

* Wings burst from your back, destroying anything in your chestplate slot
* Direct sunlight withers you
* You have Night Vision and Regeneration
* Undead won't attack you unless they're under the power of a lich
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must drink blood from creatures by damaging them
* Bats become vampiric when they're near you

**Form of the Werebunny**: Kill a rabbit to obtain this form

* Your body grows fur and powerful muscles, destroying anything in your
  chestplate slot
* Direct moonlight increases your speed and makes you ravenously hungry
* You have Strength and Jump Boost II
* You can eat only carrots and raw meat for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Rabbits become rabid when they're near you

**Form of the Turtle**: Kill a turtle to obtain this form

* You grow a turtle shell, destroying anything in your helmet slot
* You die if your shell breaks
* You have Slowness, Dolphin's Grace, and Resistance III
* You can eat only dried kelp for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Turtles become more turtley when they're near you

Known Issues:

* This pack uses teams and is incompatible with other data packs that use
  teams
* Sunlight and moonlight affect players even when it's raining or snowing
  because Java edition does not have a `/weather query` command
* Food that rots will always produce either two rotten flesh or one
  poisonous potato because preserving stack sizes with `/replaceitem` is only
  possible with hacky shulker box workarounds
* If a player in turtle form dies from their shell breaking, other players who
  die in the same tick will have their death messages suppressed

== Ordering Data Packs

Some, though not all, addon & companion datapacks have features that require
another pack to be enabled and loaded before them.
The following shows the preferred order of datapacks that depend on each other.
If you want all features available,
this is the order packs should be enabled and loaded in,
i.e. this is the _reverse_ of their relative priority.

----
heads_fae.zip
loot_overhaul.zip
loot_overhaul_treasure_barrels.zip
loot_overhaul_relics.zip
loot_overhaul_starter_relic.zip
loot_overhaul_treasure_seeds.zip
phantasmal.zip
relics_mythic.zip
----

Data packs should be in this order in the output of `/datapack list`.
In the Select Data Packs screen,
they should be ordered this way from _bottom to top_,
NOT top to bottom as one might intuitively expect.

To reorder datapacks, use the
https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/datapack[`/datapack`]
command.

== Language Support

Some resource packs rename certain blocks or items.
Renaming in languages other than `en_us` (US English)
is done on a best effort basis.
Below is a summary of resource packs that support other language codes.
You can use
https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language#Languages[the Language page]
on the Minecraft Wiki to look up a language code.

== Spellsmithing

Spellsmithing is the process of working magical enchantments onto an item in
the smithing table.
It works a little differently than traditional Minecraft smithing.

Both forms of smithing preserve the magic of the item in the left input slot,
and destroy any magic on the item in the right output slot.
So in order to preserve the magic of an enchanted upgrade item, it needs to go
in the left slot with the tool on the right, and the order is reversed compared to
traditional smithing.

It can be a bit confusing and counterintuitive at first, but just remember that
the magic that you want to preserve is what goes in the left slot.
The <<spellsmithing-guide,Spellsmithing Guide>> resource pack can help with that.
It can also be useful to shift-click items into the smithing GUI, which will
always put the item into the correct slot.

=== Boon Enchantments

Boons are a type of enchantment that work a little differently
from normal enchantments. They are a bit unintuitive and finnicky due to
magic's unpredictable nature.

Like all enchantments, boons magically augment the tool they enchant.
Like most enchantments, they're destroyed when a tool is repaired in the
crafting grid.

Like curses, boons can't be removed in the grindstone,
and their tooltip text isn't white like normal enchantments.
Unlike curses, the grindstone removes their sheen,
and their tooltip isn't red.

Like treasure enchantments, boons can't be obtained from the enchanting table,
and must be found in the world.

Unlike other enchantments, boons can't be obtained from trading
and aren't found on books. Instead, they are usually
found on small items such as shards, trinkets, gems, or nuggets. To put the
boon on a tool, it needs to be worked in the smithing table.

When combining tools in the anvil, a boon in the left slot will be preserved
and a boon in the right slot will be destroyed. Applying ingots or enchanted
books with the anvil works normally.

Boons have a light green tooltip by default.
Boons with these light green tooltips require a datapack to obtain and apply
to a tool, but they continue to function even without a datapack.

=== Glamer Enchantments

Glamers are enchantments added by the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>> datapack
that can be applied to item frames
in the smithing table to give them illusory effects such as invisibility.
The illusions are incredibly convincing and can be
interacted with as if they are real, but they're destroyed when the
item frame is broken.

Glamers are identical to boons in all other ways.

=== Mythic Enchantments

Mythic enchantments are boons with tooltips that are light blue instead of
green. Their effects are often more powerful and/or complex than a typical
boon, and require a datapack to function.

If the datapack is uninstalled, or if it's incompatible with the version of
Minecraft you're using, mythic enchantments continue to display their tooltip,
but their effects cease to work and become mere myths.

=== Relics

A relic is a shard, trinket, or gem with impossible magic -- either a boon
enchantment, some combination of mutually exclusive enchantments,
or an enchantment that can be put on a tool that normally couldn't have it.
Relics can be applied to tools in the smithing table.

Below is a description of the common relics added by the
<<starter-item,Starter Relic>>, <<ender-relic,Ender Relic>>,
and <<relic-loot,Relic Loot>> datapacks.
For a list of mythic relics, see the <<mythic-relics,Mythic Relics>> datapack
description.

TO DO AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=============================

Run `make update`
Check and resolve automatic changes with `git status && git diff`
Merge loot table changes with Loot Overhaul
Check for new Mineable blocks in data/minecraft/tags/blocks/unmineable.json
Add new plants to Gardener Endermen
Add new smooth and cracked blocks to More Cutting
Add new warm blocks to Warmer Striders
Add new potions to Brewing Guide
Add new ores to Ore Types
Add new End blocks to mk-dragonproof.sh
Add new leashable mobs to #buce:leashed/leashable
Add new leashable mobs to #buce:mythic/leashing/leashable
Add new floating mobs to #buce:mythic/balloons/balloons

HOW TO UPDATE LOOT TABLES AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=================================================

Extract the necessary folders from the new jar,
then switch to the loot_tables folder

 make update
 cd data/minecraft/loot_tables

Convert the original tables from YAML to JSON

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +

Compare the new and old tables using diff

 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in.*yaml$' | vim -

If diff complains about newlines, append newlines to the new tables

 find orig.new/ -name \*.json | while read file; do echo >> "$file"; done

Edit the loot table template or what-have-you to update whatever formatting
changes Mojang made to the JSON

 vim loot_table.j2

Repeat important steps as necessary

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +
 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in.*yaml$' | vim -
 vim loot_table.j2

Commit changes in the usual way
