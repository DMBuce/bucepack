=== Note Guide


Adds a display to the top of note blocks that shows the note it's tuned to
and its position on a keyboard.

image::https://i.imgur.com/Nb8e9mn.png[Note Guide]

Unfortunately, note blocks don't have an orientation, so in this texture pack,
the direction they face depends on the instrument it's set to, i.e. the
block underneath:

* Facing West: bass, snare, hat, basedrum (wood/sand/glass/stone)
* Facing North: harp, guitar, iron_xylophone, xylophone (dirt/wool/iron/bone)
* Facing South: cow_bell, chime, flute, bell (soul sand/packed ice/clay/gold)
* Facing East: didgeridoo, pling, banjo, bit (pumpkin/glowstone/hay/emerald)

=== Ore Types

Organizes ores into types to provide more variety and consistency

image::https://i.imgur.com/kXCHAdS.png[Ore Types]

* "Metallic" ores (Iron, Gold) are unchanged
* "Gemlike" ores (Diamond, Redstone) match emerald's gemlike texture
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) use a random mixture of the default coal ore,
  the default lapis ore, and the default quartz ore shapes.

As an originally unintended bonus,
gemlike ores stick up one pixel above lava,
so you can find them a bit more easily.
