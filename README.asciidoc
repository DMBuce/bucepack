=== Note Guide


Adds a display to the top of note blocks that shows the note it's tuned to
and its position on a keyboard.

image::https://i.imgur.com/Nb8e9mn.png[Note Guide]

Unfortunately, note blocks don't have an orientation, so in this texture pack,
the direction they face depends on the instrument it's set to, i.e. the
block underneath:

* Facing West: bass, snare, hat, basedrum (wood/sand/glass/stone)
* Facing North: harp, guitar, iron_xylophone, xylophone (dirt/wool/iron/bone)
* Facing South: cow_bell, chime, flute, bell (soul sand/packed ice/clay/gold)
* Facing East: didgeridoo, pling, banjo, bit (pumpkin/glowstone/hay/emerald)

Build: `make note_guide.zip`

=== Brew Guide

Adds a simple cheat sheet to the brewing stand GUI to remind you how potions are made.

image::https://i.imgur.com/hhyxHA2.png[Brew Guide]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make brew_guide.zip`

=== Tech Arrows

Adds arrows to the top of hoppers and the side of observers so that you can
see which direction they're pointing. The observer's arrows light up when they
activate so that you can see signals passing through them.

//image::https://i.imgur.com/RwOzhsR.png[Tech Arrows]

=== Villager Mech

Turns iron golems into mechsuit-wearing villagers.

image::https://i.imgur.com/oF0MLK9.png[Village Mech]

Build: `make villager_mech.zip`

=== Pig Armor

Adds iron armor to saddled pigs.

image::https://i.imgur.com/KA4glG4.png[Pig Armor]

This is an aesthetic change only,
it doesn't reduce the damage that pigs take.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make pig_armor.zip`

=== Ravager

Moves the ravager's eyes to the side of its face.

image::https://i.imgur.com/bJEeUdc.png[Ravager]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make ravager.zip`

=== Ore Types

Mixes classic ore textures with the modern ones introduced in 1.17 to provide
more variety in ore shapes.
Nether and deepslate ores are left unchanged, while stone ores use a simple,
classic-inspired aesthetic that pairs well with stone's clean texture.

//image::https://i.imgur.com/kXCHAdS.png[Ore Types]
image::https://i.imgur.com/G4xb3Q7.png[Ore Types]

Rather than simply reverting the stone ores to their 1.16 version,
this pack organizes them into "types" that determine the ore's shape.

* "Metallic" ores (Copper, Iron, Gold) are shaped like classic iron ore
* "Gemlike" ores (Redstone, Diamond, Emerald) use the old emerald shape
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) are shaped like modern coal ore

As an originally unintended bonus,
gemlike ores stick up one pixel above lava,
so you can find them a bit more easily.

=== Discreet Pumpkin

Makes the pumpkin helmet gui less obtrusive.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make speedy_paths.zip`

=== Mineable

In vanilla Minecraft, certain blocks like glass have no tool associated with
them, so their breaking speed is the same whether you're using your fist or a
tool or an Efficiency tool. This pack gives more blocks an associated tool.

Blocks associated with picks:

* Glass
* Stained Glass
* Glass Panes
* Tinted Glass
* Beacon
* Sea Lantern

* Lever
* Smithing Table

image::https://i.imgur.com/7tN7Zij.png[Shearless]

Note that shears are still required to shear sheep, mooshroom, snow golems,
pumpkins, beehives, and bee nests.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the
loot tables of the blocks shown above.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make shearless.zip`

=== More Shulker Shells

Gives shulkers a chance to drop 2 shulker shells when killed with looting.
Higher levels increase the chance of two shells dropping, as shown in the
table below.

          |      Looting Level
          |---------------------------
 # Shells |  0  |   I   |  II   | III

        2 |     | 13.0% | 39.1% | 50%

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the Shulker
loot table.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make more_shulker_shells.zip`

=== Fortunate Jungle

Increases the drop rate of jungle saplings harvested with fortune hoes.
The table below summarizes the drop rates of jungle saplings with and without this pack,
as well as the drop rate of other saplings.

 Drop                     | Source        | No Fortune  | Fortune I     | Fortune II    | Fortune III  | Fortune IV+
 -------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+--------------+------------

 Other Saplings           | Other Leaves  | 5% (1⁄20)   | 6.25% (1⁄16)  | 8.33% (1⁄12)  | 10% (1⁄10)   |

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the Jungle
Leaves loot table.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make fortunate_jungle.zip`

=== Lose HP & XP

Once any player enters a nether portal, all players stop healing from food.

Once the dragon or wither have been defeated, players stop losing their items
when they die, and lose all XP when they die. The XP does not drop as orbs.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make lose_hp_xp.zip`

=== More Rain

Adds a chance of rain overnight.

Whenever a player skips the night with a bed, there is an 11% chance of rain
that morning.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make more_rain.zip`

=== Phantasmal

More phantasmal phantoms.

When a phantom hits a player, it becomes incorporeal.
Its attacks lose knockback,
it stops colliding with and pushing entities,
and its body turns invisible
(although its eyes and smoke particles can still be seen).

When a player hits a phantom, all nearby phantoms turn visible.

When an invisible phantom hits a player, it disappears in a puff of smoke.

All the above effects only apply to phantoms in the overworld.

Phantoms killed by a player have a chance to drop a membrane with
Glamer of Invisibility, an enchantment that can be applied to an item
frame in the smithing table to make an invisible item frame.

//If you install this data pack as a resource pack, invisible item frames will
//have a translucent item texture in the inventory

This pack is a companion to the <<mother-phantoms,Mother Phantoms>> datapack,
which adds more corporeal phantoms to The End; and the
<<glow-squid-glamers,Glow Squid Glamers>> datapack, which lets you obtain
armor stand glamers from glow squid.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make phantasmal.zip`

Known Issues: The Glamer of Invisibility can't be applied to armor stands
because of https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-66068[intended behavior]
that prevents invisible armor stands from being broken.

=== Mother Phantoms

Adds phantom bosses to The End.

When a player uses Ender Crystals to summon the Ender Dragon,
up to three Mother Phantoms spawn with it.
One Mother Phantom spawns the first time the dragon is summoned, two
spawn the second time, and three Mother Phantoms spawn for each subsequent
dragon fight.

Mother Phantoms are larger than normal, deal extra damage, and have extra health.
Whenever a player hits a Mother Phantom, each Mother Phantom turns invisible
and has a 25% chance to spawn a normal phantom.
Mother Phantoms lose invisibility when they hit a player.
They have a chance to drop their head when they die.

Mother Phantoms is a companion pack to the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>> datapack,
which makes phantoms in the Overworld more incorporeal.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make mother_phantoms.zip`

=== Glow Squid Glamers

Adds custom glamer enchantments that drop from glow squid and can be used to
give armor stands minor illusory effects.

Glow squid with the glowing potion effect that die have a chance to drop a
glow ink sac with one or more custom glamer enchantments on it. The
enchantments can be applied to armor stands in the smithing table to give them
minor illusory effects. The illusions are incredibly convincing and can be
interacted with as if they are real.

Each enchantment makes an armor stand's base invisible, gives it illusory
arms, and provides one other effect as summarized below.

* Glamer of Shrinking: Makes the armor stand appear smaller
* Glamer of the Default Pose: Gives "default_pose" from bedrock edition (no effect)
* Glamer of No Pose: Gives "no_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Solemn: Gives the "solemn_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Gesture: Gives the "athena_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of Brandishing: Gives the "brandish_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of Honor: Gives the "honor_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of Entertaining: Gives the "entertain_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Salute: Gives the "salute_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Hero: Gives the "hero_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of Riposte: Gives the "riposte_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Zombie: Gives the "zombie_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Leftward Cancan: Gives the "cancan_a_pose" from bedrock edition
* Glamer of the Rightward Cancan: Gives the "cancan_b_pose" from bedrock edition

//If you install this data pack as a resource pack, armor stands with poses will
//have an appropriate item texture in the inventory

This pack is a companion to the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>> and
<<squid-glamer,Squid Glamer>> datapacks,
each of which let you obtain a glamer that makes item frames invisible.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make glow_squid_glamers.zip`

=== Invisible Squid Glamers

Squid (but not glow squid) with invisibility that die have a chance to drop
ink with Glamer of Invisibility, an enchantment that can be applied to an item
frame in the smithing table to make an invisible item frame.

//If you install this data pack as a resource pack, invisible item frames will
//have a translucent item texture in the inventory

This pack is a companion to the
<<glow-squid-glamers,Glow Squid Glamers>> datapack, which lets you obtain
armor stand glamers from glow squid.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make squid_glamers.zip`

Known Issues: The Glamer of Invisibility can't be applied to armor stands
because of https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-66068[intended behavior]
that prevents invisible armor stands from being broken.

=== Loot Overhaul

Overhauls the vanilla loot tables to make early-to-midgame exploration more
exciting. Many, though not all, of the loot changes are described below.

Saddles, horse armor, nametags and leads are craftable and removed from the
loot tables to make room for other loot. This is to avoid changing the rarity
of some entries like ore ingots. Nearly all loot table entries added by this
pack are replacements for the entries that it removes.

image::https://i.imgur.com/uKTapeF.png[Snout Banner Pattern]

Bonus spawn chests generate a more limited and curated set of starter items
designed to jumpstart the tree-punching phase of a fresh world:
3-5 cobble, 3-5 logs, and 2-3 bread. Additional items can be added to the
bonus spawn chest with one or more of the <<starter-item,Starter Item>>
datapacks below.

Food loot is themed according to the structure it spawns in.
To give a few examples:
Underground structures have potatoes and carrots.
Villager and illager structures have pie, cookies, and cake.
Ocean chests have salmon and cod.
Desert and jungle temples occasionally have honey.

More chests spawn music discs, and it's possible to find every music disc in a
chest instead of just Cat and 13.

Some chests have custom explorer maps that lead to other structures. For
example, Woodland Mansion chests have a chance to spawn a Reconnaissance Map
that leads to a Pillager Outpost, and the chest in the outpost has a chance to
spawn a Swamp Exploration Map that leads to a Witch Hut. Maps found in Nether
Fortresses lead to Piglin Bastions, and vice versa. End City chests have a
chance to spawn a map leading to another End City. Maps leading to Jungle
Temples can generate in Stronghold Libraries. And so on.

End Cities generate only diamond gear rather than a mix of diamond and iron,
and Woodland Mansions can rarely generate a conduit, beacon, or shulker box.

Instead of generating seeds, End Cities and Woodland Mansions generate plant
resources that you haven't used yet. Such resources include everything from
berries, wheat seeds and potatoes to cactus, bamboo, and rose bushes. If you
haven't eaten, planted, or otherwise used one of the items shown below, you
have a chance to find it in End City and Woodland Mansion chests.

image::https://i.imgur.com/gUnJW5S.png[Treasure Seeds]


Enchanted books in most loot tables spawn with a 50% chance to be enchanted
with multiple enchants instead of a single random enchant. Enchanted
books found in libraries and map rooms have the other 50% spawn as a
treasure enchant instead of a single random enchant.

The soul speed books and gear normally found in nether chests have a
random treasure enchant instead. More nether chests have such books. Note that
books obtained through bartering still generate with Soul Speed 100% of the
time.

Most armor & tools are enchanted at an enchantment level determined by the
area the structure spawns in. Aboveground structures have gear enchanted at
levels 15-20, underground and ocean structures at levels 20-25, nether
structures at levels 25-30, and end structures at levels 25-39.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the chest or
fishing loot tables.

Build: `make loot_overhaul.zip`

//=== Relic Loot
//
//This is an addon pack for the
//<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
//datapack above. It adds <<Relics>> to the loot tables that spawn with a one
//in a thousand chance in chests and a one in a million chance from fishing.

//Build: `make relic_loot.zip`

=== Starter Item

This is a series of addon datapacks for the
<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
pack above. Each pack adds one additional item to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Bed adds a Red Bed to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Book adds a Book & Quill to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Bucket adds a Bucket to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Map adds a Map to the bonus spawn chest.

Starter Shulker adds a Shulker Box to the bonus spawn chest.

If several of the above Starter Item packs are installed, the bonus chest will spawn one
starter item chosen at random.

Starter Bonus Chest adds a bonus spawn chest to each player's
inventory the first time they join the world.

Starter Relic adds a random <<relics,Relic>> to each player's
inventory the first time they join the world. It does not change the bonus
spawn chest.

=== Breeding Overhaul

Overhauls breeding mechanics for horses, donkeys, mules, and llamas.

In vanilla Minecraft, the traits of these animals (health for llamas; health,
speed, and jump strength for the rest) are determined by taking the
average of the parents and a randomly generated creature.

In this datapack, for each trait there is a 25% chance to use the vanilla
algorithm, a 50% chance to use one of the parents' trait (25% for each
parent), and a 25% chance to use a randomly generated trait.

Build: `make breeding_overhaul.zip`

=== Escape the Nether

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in the Nether.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the wither.
Until you do that, you'll respawn in the Nether in a cage made of fungus and
netherbrick.

//image::[Escape the Nether]

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make escape_nether.zip`

=== Escape the End

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in The End.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the dragon and obtain
elytra -- but not necessarily in that order. Until you do those two things,
you'll respawn on The End platform with slimestone materials in your inventory
that you can use to travel to the outer end islands.

//image::[Escape the End]

If you want to use this pack and Escape the Nether to play minecraft in
reverse, i.e. if you want to beat The End to gain access to the Nether and
then beat the Nether to gain access to the overworld, install them both in the
usual way and then run these commands:

    /datapack disable "file/escape_end.zip"
    /datapack enable "file/escape_end.zip" after "file/escape_nether.zip"

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make escape_end.zip`

=== Escape the Grind

The two data packs above, Escape the Nether and Escape the End, provide a
survival experience outside the overworld with a bare minimum of
additions to make the game still playable. Part of the challenge is
that normal parts of the game aren't available to you. For example, ranged
combat is not possible using only materials found in The End, and enchanting
isn't possible using only materials found in the Nether.

Escape the Grind is a 1.16.x addon data pack that's designed to reduce the grind of,
and add possibilities to, a Nether-only or End-only survival experience.

Changes that facilitate survival in Nether:

* You're given a saddle and a mushroom on a stick whenever you respawn
* Grindstones can be crafted using a polished blackstone slab
* There's a chance that crying obsidian will drop lapis when broken

Changes that facilitate survival in The End:

* In addition to slimestone materials, you're given TNT whenever you respawn
* While holding ender pearls in both your main hand and offhand, purple
  particles indicate you're looking in the direction of an end city and sandy
  particles indicate you're looking within 90 degrees of one
* End city loot includes fireworks and enchanted crossbows

=== Hardcore Lichdom

Hardcore Lichdom is a 1.16.x challenge datapack designed for hardcore mode.  With
this pack, players who conquer the Illagers, the Ocean, the Wither, and The
End without dying can gain immortality and keep their world forever.
Advancements document the basics of the data pack. For more comprehensive
documentation, read on.

When you die in minecraft hardcore mode you are given the
option to spectate the world as a ghost. If you use rare materials to perform
the proper rituals, you can cheat death and become a lich, a powerful
undead that can use a phylactery pedestal to regenerate your body and restore
your ghost form to life.

To become a lich, you will need:

* Totem of Undying
* Dry Sponge
* Trident with Loyalty III
* Cauldron
* Dragon Head
* Beacon

image::https://i.imgur.com/dxgHI3n.png[Hardcore Lichdom]

Make sure the cauldron has water in it, then throw the totem, sponge, and
loyalty trident in to turn the totem into a phylactery. Place the dragon head
on top of the beacon, then throw the phylactery on top of the dragon head to
create a phylactery pedestal.

image::https://i.imgur.com/a04jraC.png[Phylactery Pedestal]

Choose the location for your phylactery pedestal carefully with the following
in mind:

* The pedestal block can't be moved or destroyed once created
* The phylactery item can't despawn or be picked up, but it's otherwise a
  normal item that can be destroyed by fire and explosions
* You may want to shield the phylactery pedestal from the sun so you aren't
  affected by its debilitating effects when you respawn (see below)

Once the phylactery pedestal is built, you will need a magic user's help to
become a lich. Simply convince a witch to kill you with magic damage, and
lichdom is yours. Once the witch kills you, your ghost form will be able to
obtain a new body at the phylactery pedestal.

Lichdom has the following consequences and benefits:

* Direct sunlight poisons you
* Undead won't attack you
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must steal necromantic energy from other undead by
  damaging them
* Some animals transform when they're near you -- bats become vampiric,
  rabbits become rabid, and turtles become more turtley

In addition, as a lich you can gain different sets of abilities, called
"forms", by killing certain animals. The animal forms available to you are
described below, and replace the lich powers described above. To revert to
lich form, you can either kill a villager or die and regenerate your body at a
pedestal.

**Form of the Vampire**: Kill a bat to obtain this form

* Wings burst from your back, destroying anything in your chestplate slot
* Direct sunlight withers you
* You have Night Vision and Regeneration
* Undead won't attack you unless they're under the power of a lich
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must drink blood from creatures by damaging them
* Bats become vampiric when they're near you

**Form of the Werebunny**: Kill a rabbit to obtain this form

* Your body grows fur and powerful muscles, destroying anything in your
  chestplate slot
* Direct moonlight increases your speed and makes you ravenously hungry
* You have Strength and Jump Boost II
* You can eat only carrots and raw meat for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Rabbits become rabid when they're near you

**Form of the Turtle**: Kill a turtle to obtain this form

* You grow a turtle shell, destroying anything in your helmet slot
* You die if your shell breaks
* You have Slowness, Dolphin's Grace, and Resistance III
* You can eat only dried kelp for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Turtles become more turtley when they're near you

Known Issues:

* This pack uses teams and is incompatible with other data packs that use
  teams
* Sunlight and moonlight affect players even when it's raining or snowing
  because Java edition does not have a `/weather query` command
* Food that rots will always produce either two rotten flesh or one
  poisonous potato because preserving stack sizes with `/replaceitem` is only
  possible with hacky shulker box workarounds
* If a player in turtle form dies from their shell breaking, other players who
  die in the same tick will have their death messages suppressed

=== No Treasure Maps

Replaces Treasure Maps with Hearts of the Sea in shipwreck chests as a workaround for an issue in

== Spellsmithing

Spellsmithing is the process of working magical enchantments onto an item in
the smithing table.
It works a little differently than traditional Minecraft smithing.

Both forms of smithing require two input items and give you an output item.
Both forms of smithing preserve the magic of the item in the left input slot,
and destroy any magic on the item in the right output slot.

In normal smithing, you apply the material on the right to the tool on the
left to create a tool with the properties of the upgrade material. The magic
of the tool from the left side is preserved.

But when smithing with magical upgrade materials, the order is reversed
because it's the magic of the
upgrade item that needs to be preserved. So the upgrade item goes in the left
slot, not the right slot. You apply the enchantments on
the left to the tool on the right to upgrade it with the magic of the upgrade
item.

When spellsmithing, it can be a bit confusing and unintuitive to put the
upgrade item and the tool in the opposite order. Just remember that
the magic that you want to preserve is what goes in the left slot.
//The Spellsmithing Guide resource pack can help with that.
It can also be useful to shift-click items into the smithing GUI, which will
always put the item into the correct slot.

=== Boon Enchantments

Boons are a type of enchantment that work a little differently
from normal enchantments.

Like all enchantments, they magically augment the tool they enchant.
Like most enchantments, they're removed when repairing a tool in the crafting
grid.

Like curses, boons can't be removed in the grindstone,
and their tooltip text isn't white like normal enchantments. Unlike curses,
their tooltip isn't red.

Like treasure enchantments, boons can't be obtained from the enchanting table,
and must be found in the world.

Unlike other enchantments, boons can't be obtained from trading, can't be
worked in the anvil, and aren't found on books. Instead, they are usually
found on small items such as shards, trinkets, gems, or nuggets. To put the
boon on a tool, it needs to be worked in the smithing table.

Boons also don't give items a shimmering enchantment sheen,
and their item tooltip text is light green by default.
Boons with these light green tooltips require a datapack to obtain and apply
to a tool, but they continue to function even without a datapack.

=== Glamer Enchantments

Glamers are enchantments added by the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>>,
<<glow-squid-glamers,Glow Squid Glamers>>, and
<<invisible-squid-glamer,Invisible Squid Glamer>> datapacks
that can be applied to item frames and/or armor
stands in the smithing table to give them visual effects such as invisibility
or illusory arms. If an item frame or armor stand placed this way is broken,
the glamer is destroyed.

Glamers are identical to boons in all other ways.

=== Mythic Enchantments

Mythic enchantments are boons with tooltips that are light blue instead of
green. Their effects are often more powerful and/or complex than a typical
boon, and require a datapack to function.

If the datapack is uninstalled, or if it's incompatible with the version of
Minecraft you're using (e.g. because you upgraded Minecraft and not the
datapack), mythic enchantments continue to display their tooltip, but their
effects cease to work, becoming mere myths.

=== Relics

Relics are rare items added by the <<starter-items,Starter Relic>>
and/or <<relic-loot,Relic Loot>> datapacks.

A relic is a shard, trinket, or gem with impossible magic -- either a boon
enchantment or some combination of mutually exclusive
enchantments. A relic's enchantments can be applied to the appropriate tool in
the smithing table.

* **Relic of Knockback**: a piece of flint with Knockback V that can be applied to
  a shovel or hoe in the smithing table
* **Relic of Endlessness**: a stick with Infinity and Mending that can be
  applied to a bow in the smithing table
* **Relic of Vitality**: a glistering melon with Boon of Vitality, a custom
  enchantment that can be applied to a netherite chestplate in the smithing
  table to give five extra hearts
* **Relic of Speed**: a rabbit's foot with Boon of Speed, a custom enchantment
  that can be applied to leather leggings in the smithing table to give a
  persistent Speed II effect
* **Relic of Smiting**: a bone with Sharpness IV and Smite IV that can be
  applied to a sword or axe in the smithing table
* **Relic of Sharpness**: a diamond with Sharpness V that that can be applied
  to a pickaxe in the smithing table
* **Relic of Quick Swing**: a prismarine shard with Boon of Quick Swinging, a
  custom enchantment that that can be applied to a trident in the smithing
  table to give increased attack speed
* **Relic of Frost and Flood**: a prismarine crystal with Frost Walker II and
  Depth Strider III that can be applied to golden boots in the smithing table
* **Relic of Protection**: a scute with Protection IV and Blast Protection II
  that can be applied to a turtle shell in the smithing table
* **Relic of Striding**: a sugar cube with Depth Strider III and Feather
  Falling IV that can be applied to horse armor in the smithing table
* **Relic of Projectile Protection**: a piece of leather with Projectile
  Protection II that can be applied to elytra in the smithing table

=== Mythic Relics

Some relics have <<mythic-enchantments,Mythic Enchantments>>,
powerful magic with unique abilities.
Sometimes mythic relics are found as a shard, trinket,
or gem that can be worked onto a tool in the smithing table.
Others are found as a tool with the enchantment already applied.

//Below is a summary of the data packs that mythic relics can be found in.
//
//* **Ephemeral Wings of Cloaking**: <<mother-phantoms,Mother Phantoms>>
//* **Seeker's Scope**: <<escape-the-end,Escape the End>>

TO DO AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=============================

Merge loot table changes with Loot Overhaul
Add new food to relic predicate
Add new plants to Gardener Endermen and Shearless packs
Add new ores to Ore Types
Add new End blocks to Dragonproof
Add new potions to Brewing Guide
Add new hostile mobs to beheading loot table
Add new smooth & cracked blocks to stonecutter

HOW TO UPDATE LOOT TABLES AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=================================================

Extract the necessary folders from the new jar

 mkdir 1.17
 cd 1.17
 jar xf ~/.minecraft/versions/1.17/1.17.jar assets data
 cd ..

Copy new loot tables to orig.new folder

 mkdir data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new
 rsync -av 1.17.jar/data/minecraft/loot_tables/{gameplay,chests} data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new/
 cd data/minecraft/loot_tables

Convert the original tables from YAML to JSON

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +

Compare the new and old tables using diff

 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -

If diff complains about newlines, append newlines to the new tables

 find orig.new/ -name \*.json | while read file; do echo >> "$file"; done

Edit the loot table template or what-have-you to update whatever formatting
changes Mojang made to the JSON

 vim loot_table.j2 

Repeat important steps as necessary

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +
 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -
 vim loot_table.j2 

Commit changes in the usual way
