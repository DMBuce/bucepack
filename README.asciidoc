BucePack is a simple Makefile that I use to build my Minecraft resource packs,
described below.

This is an aesthetic change only,
it doesn't reduce the damage that pigs take.

Build: `make pigarmor.zip`

Ore Types
---------

Organizes ores into types to provide more variety and consistency

* "Smeltable" ores (Iron, Gold) are unchanged
* "Gemlike" ores (Diamond, Redstone) match emerald's gemlike texture
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) use a mixture of shapes,
  with 50% similar to the default coal ore and
  50% similar to the default lapis ore

As an originally unintended bonus,
gemlike ores stick up one pixel above lava,
so you can find them a bit more easily.
