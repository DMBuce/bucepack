=== Note Guide


Adds a display to the top of note blocks that shows the note it's tuned to
and its position on a keyboard.

image::https://i.imgur.com/Nb8e9mn.png[Note Guide]

Unfortunately, note blocks don't have an orientation, so in this texture pack,
the direction they face depends on the instrument it's set to, i.e. the
block underneath:

* Facing West: bass, snare, hat, basedrum (wood/sand/glass/stone)
* Facing North: harp, guitar, iron_xylophone, xylophone (dirt/wool/iron/bone)
* Facing South: cow_bell, chime, flute, bell (soul sand/packed ice/clay/gold)
* Facing East: didgeridoo, pling, banjo, bit (pumpkin/glowstone/hay/emerald)

are made.

//image::https://i.imgur.com/hhyxHA2.png[Brew Guide]
image::https://i.imgur.com/drQalxO.png[Brew Guide]

There's also a dark mode version available that's adapted from
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/default-dark-mode[nebulr's Default Dark Mode]
resource pack.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build:

 make brew_guide.zip
 make brew_guide_darkmode.zip

=== Tech Arrows

Adds arrows to the top of hoppers and the side of observers so that you can
see which direction they're pointing. The observer's arrows light up when they
activate so that you can see signals passing through them.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make ravager.zip`

=== Ore Types

Mixes classic ore textures with the modern ones introduced in 1.17 to provide
more variety in ore shapes.
Nether and deepslate ores are left unchanged, while stone ores use a simple,
classic-inspired aesthetic that pairs well with stone's clean texture.

image::https://i.imgur.com/G4xb3Q7.png[Ore Types]

Rather than simply reverting the stone ores to their 1.16 version,
this pack organizes them into "types" that determine the ore's shape.

* "Metallic" ores (Copper, Iron, Gold) are shaped like classic iron ore
* "Gemlike" ores (Redstone, Diamond, Emerald) use the old emerald shape
* "Lumpy" ores (Coal, Lapis) are shaped like modern coal ore

== Gameplay Data Packs

Data packs that open up new possibilities for things to do in the game.

=== Breeding Overhaul

Overhauls breeding mechanics for horses, donkeys, mules, and llamas.

In vanilla Minecraft, the traits of these animals (health for llamas; health,
speed, and jump strength for the rest) are determined by taking the
average of the parents and a randomly generated creature.

In this datapack, for each trait there is a 25% chance to use the vanilla
algorithm, a 50% chance to use one of the parents' trait (25% for each
parent), and a 25% chance to use a randomly generated trait.

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make breeding_overhaul.zip`

=== Dragonproof End

Download: https://github.com/DMBuce/bucepack/releases

Build: `make dragonproof.zip`

=== Loot Overhaul

Overhauls the vanilla loot tables to make early-to-midgame exploration more
exciting. Many, though not all, of the loot changes are described below.

Saddles, horse armor, nametags and leads are craftable and removed from the
loot tables to make room for other loot. This is to avoid changing the rarity
of some entries like ore ingots. Nearly all loot table entries added by this
pack are replacements for the entries that it removes.

Bonus spawn chests generate a more limited and curated set of starter items
designed to jumpstart the tree-punching phase of a fresh world:
3-5 cobble, 3-5 logs, and 2-3 bread. Additional items can be added to the
bonus spawn chest with one or more <<starter-item,Starter Item>>
datapacks, or the <<starter-relic,Starter Relic>> datapack.

Food loot is themed according to the structure it spawns in.
To give a few examples:
Underground structures have potatoes and carrots.
Villager and illager structures have pie, cookies, and cake.
Ocean chests have salmon and cod.
Desert and jungle temples occasionally have honey.

More chests spawn music discs, and it's possible to find every music disc in a
chest instead of just Cat and 13.

Some chests have custom explorer maps that lead to other structures. For
example, Woodland Mansion chests have a chance to spawn a Reconnaissance Map
that leads to a Pillager Outpost, and the chest in the outpost has a chance to
spawn a Swamp Exploration Map that leads to a Witch Hut. Maps found in Nether
Fortresses lead to Piglin Bastions, and vice versa. End City chests have a
chance to spawn a map leading to another End City. Maps leading to Jungle
Temples can generate in Stronghold Libraries. And so on.

End Cities generate only diamond gear rather than a mix of diamond and iron,
and Woodland Mansions can rarely generate a conduit, beacon, or shulker box.

Enchanted books in most loot tables spawn with a 50% chance to be enchanted
with multiple enchants instead of a single random enchant. Enchanted
books found in libraries and map rooms have the other 50% spawn as a
treasure enchant instead of a single random enchant.

The soul speed books and gear normally found in nether chests have a
random treasure enchant instead. More nether chests have such books. Note that
books obtained through bartering still generate with Soul Speed 100% of the
time.

Most armor & tools are enchanted at an enchantment level determined by the
area the structure spawns in. Aboveground structures have gear enchanted at
levels 15-20, underground and ocean structures at levels 20-25, nether
structures at levels 25-30, and end structures at levels 25-39.

This datapack is not compatible with other datapacks that modify the chest or
fishing loot tables.

Build: `make loot_overhaul.zip`

==== Plant Loot

This is an addon pack for the <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> datapack that
adds plant resources that you haven't used yet to the End City and Woodland
Mansion loot tables. Such resources include everything from
berries, wheat seeds and potatoes to cactus, bamboo, and rose bushes. If you
haven't eaten, planted, or otherwise used one of the items shown below, you
have a chance to find it in End City and Woodland Mansion chests.

This is an addon pack for the <<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>> datapack that
adds a random <<relics,Relic>> to the bonus spawn chest.

If any other <<starter-item,Starter Item>> datapacks are installed,
the starter relic is generated in addition to the starter item added by
those packs.

Build: `make starter_relic.zip`

Known Issues: Due to limitations in how Minecraft loot tables work, if you
uninstall this pack and are using Loot Overhaul in conjunction with a datapack

to the world, relics will continue to generate in bonus spawn chests until you
run `/function bucepack:loot_overhaul/disable/starter_relic`

<<loot-overhaul,Loot Overhaul>>
datapack. Each pack adds one additional item to the bonus spawn chest.

=== Glow Squid Glamers

Adds custom enchantments that drop from glow squid and can be used to
give armor stands minor illusory effects.

Glow squid with the glowing status effect that die have a chance to drop a
glow ink sac with one or more custom glamer enchantments on it. The
enchantments can be applied to armor stands in the smithing table to give them
minor illusory effects. The illusions are incredibly convincing and can be
interacted with as if they are real, but they're destroyed when the armor
stand or item frame is broken.

Each enchantment makes an armor stand's base invisible, gives it illusory
arms, and provides one other effect.

Once the dragon or wither have been defeated, players stop losing their items
when they die, and lose all XP when they die. The XP does not drop as orbs.

== Legacy Data Packs

These data packs haven't been updated for the most recent version of
Minecraft.
They also all happen to access NBT data a lot and run commands every tick,
which means they're not optimized very well yet.
Lower end devices might have trouble running them.

=== Escape the Nether

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in the Nether.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the wither.
Until you do that, you'll respawn in the Nether in a cage made of fungus and
netherbrick.

Build: `make escape_nether.zip`

=== Escape the End

A 1.16.x survival challenge that starts you in The End.
The overworld is inaccessible to you until you defeat the dragon and obtain
elytra -- but not necessarily in that order. Until you do those two things,
you'll respawn on The End platform with slimestone materials in your inventory
that you can use to travel to the outer end islands.

If you want to use this pack and Escape the Nether to play minecraft in
reverse, i.e. if you want to beat The End to gain access to the Nether and
then beat the Nether to gain access to the overworld, install them both in the
usual way and then run these commands:

    /datapack disable "file/escape_end.zip"
    /datapack enable "file/escape_end.zip" after "file/escape_nether.zip"

Build: `make escape_end.zip`

=== Escape the Grind

The two data packs above, Escape the Nether and Escape the End, provide a
survival experience outside the overworld with a bare minimum of
additions to make the game still playable. Part of the challenge is
that normal parts of the game aren't available to you. For example, ranged
combat is not possible using only materials found in The End, and enchanting
isn't possible using only materials found in the Nether.

Escape the Grind is a 1.16.x addon data pack that's designed to reduce the grind of,
and add possibilities to, a Nether-only or End-only survival experience.

Changes that facilitate survival in Nether:

* You're given a saddle and a mushroom on a stick whenever you respawn
* Grindstones can be crafted using a polished blackstone slab
* There's a chance that crying obsidian will drop lapis when broken

Changes that facilitate survival in The End:

* In addition to slimestone materials, you're given TNT whenever you respawn
* While holding ender pearls in both your main hand and offhand, purple
  particles indicate you're looking in the direction of an end city and sandy
  particles indicate you're looking within 90 degrees of one
* End city loot includes fireworks and enchanted crossbows

=== Hardcore Lichdom

Hardcore Lichdom is a 1.16.x challenge datapack designed for hardcore mode.  With
this pack, players who conquer the Illagers, the Ocean, the Wither, and The
End without dying can gain immortality and keep their world forever.
Advancements document the basics of the data pack. For more comprehensive
documentation, read on.

When you die in minecraft hardcore mode you are given the
option to spectate the world as a ghost. If you use rare materials to perform
the proper rituals, you can cheat death and become a lich, a powerful
undead that can use a phylactery pedestal to regenerate your body and restore
your ghost form to life.

To become a lich, you will need:

* Totem of Undying
* Dry Sponge
* Trident with Loyalty III
* Cauldron
* Dragon Head
* Beacon

image::https://i.imgur.com/dxgHI3n.png[Hardcore Lichdom]

Make sure the cauldron has water in it, then throw the totem, sponge, and
loyalty trident in to turn the totem into a phylactery. Place the dragon head
on top of the beacon, then throw the phylactery on top of the dragon head to
create a phylactery pedestal.

image::https://i.imgur.com/a04jraC.png[Phylactery Pedestal]

Choose the location for your phylactery pedestal carefully with the following
in mind:

* The pedestal block can't be moved or destroyed once created
* The phylactery item can't despawn or be picked up, but it's otherwise a
  normal item that can be destroyed by fire and explosions
* You may want to shield the phylactery pedestal from the sun so you aren't
  affected by its debilitating effects when you respawn (see below)

Once the phylactery pedestal is built, you will need a magic user's help to
become a lich. Simply convince a witch to kill you with magic damage, and
lichdom is yours. Once the witch kills you, your ghost form will be able to
obtain a new body at the phylactery pedestal.

Lichdom has the following consequences and benefits:

* Direct sunlight poisons you
* Undead won't attack you
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must steal necromantic energy from other undead by
  damaging them
* Some animals transform when they're near you -- bats become vampiric,
  rabbits become rabid, and turtles become more turtley

In addition, as a lich you can gain different sets of abilities, called
"forms", by killing certain animals. The animal forms available to you are
described below, and replace the lich powers described above. To revert to
lich form, you can either kill a villager or die and regenerate your body at a
pedestal.

**Form of the Vampire**: Kill a bat to obtain this form

* Wings burst from your back, destroying anything in your chestplate slot
* Direct sunlight withers you
* You have Night Vision and Regeneration
* Undead won't attack you unless they're under the power of a lich
* Food rots in your hands
* For sustenance, you must drink blood from creatures by damaging them
* Bats become vampiric when they're near you

**Form of the Werebunny**: Kill a rabbit to obtain this form

* Your body grows fur and powerful muscles, destroying anything in your
  chestplate slot
* Direct moonlight increases your speed and makes you ravenously hungry
* You have Strength and Jump Boost II
* You can eat only carrots and raw meat for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Rabbits become rabid when they're near you

**Form of the Turtle**: Kill a turtle to obtain this form

* You grow a turtle shell, destroying anything in your helmet slot
* You die if your shell breaks
* You have Slowness, Dolphin's Grace, and Resistance III
* You can eat only dried kelp for sustenance
* All other food rots in your hands
* Turtles become more turtley when they're near you

Build: `make lichdom.zip`

Known Issues:

* This pack uses teams and is incompatible with other data packs that use
  teams
* Sunlight and moonlight affect players even when it's raining or snowing
  because Java edition does not have a `/weather query` command
* Food that rots will always produce either two rotten flesh or one
  poisonous potato because preserving stack sizes with `/replaceitem` is only
  possible with hacky shulker box workarounds
* If a player in turtle form dies from their shell breaking, other players who
  die in the same tick will have their death messages suppressed

== Spellsmithing

Spellsmithing is the process of working magical enchantments onto an item in
the smithing table.
It works a little differently than traditional Minecraft smithing.

Both forms of smithing preserve the magic of the item in the left input slot,
and destroy any magic on the item in the right output slot.
So in order to preserve the magic of an enchanted upgrade item, it needs to go
in the left slot with the tool on the right, and the order is reversed compared to
traditional smithing.

It can be a bit confusing and counterintuitive at first, but just remember that
the magic that you want to preserve is what goes in the left slot.
The <<spellsmithing-guide,Spellsmithing Guide>> resource pack can help with that.
It can also be useful to shift-click items into the smithing GUI, which will
always put the item into the correct slot.

=== Boon Enchantments

Boons are a type of enchantment that work a little differently
from normal enchantments. They are a bit unintuitive and finnicky due to
magic's unpredictable nature.

Like all enchantments, boons magically augment the tool they enchant.
Like most enchantments, they're destroyed when a tool is repaired in the
crafting grid.

Like curses, boons can't be removed in the grindstone,
and their tooltip text isn't white like normal enchantments. Unlike curses,
their tooltip isn't red.

Like treasure enchantments, boons can't be obtained from the enchanting table,
and must be found in the world.

Unlike other enchantments, boons can't be obtained from trading
and aren't found on books. Instead, they are usually
found on small items such as shards, trinkets, gems, or nuggets. To put the
boon on a tool, it needs to be worked in the smithing table.

When combining tools in the anvil, a boon in the left slot will be preserved
and a boon in the right slot will be destroyed. Applying ingots or enchanted
books with the anvil works normally.

Boons also don't give items a shimmering enchantment sheen,
and their item tooltip text is light green by default.
Boons with these light green tooltips require a datapack to obtain and apply
to a tool, but they continue to function even without a datapack.

=== Glamer Enchantments

Glamers are enchantments added by the <<phantasmal,Phantasmal>>,
<<glow-squid-glamers,Glow Squid Glamers>>, and
<<invisible-squid-glamer,Invisible Squid Glamer>> datapacks
that can be applied to item frames and/or armor
stands in the smithing table to give them illusory effects such as
invisibility or fake arms. The illusions are incredibly convincing and can be
interacted with as if they are real, but they're destroyed when the armor
stand is broken.

Glamers are identical to boons in all other ways.

=== Mythic Enchantments

Mythic enchantments are boons with tooltips that are light blue instead of
green. Their effects are often more powerful and/or complex than a typical
boon, and require a datapack to function.

If the datapack is uninstalled, or if it's incompatible with the version of
Minecraft you're using (e.g. because you upgraded Minecraft and not the
datapack), mythic enchantments continue to display their tooltip, but their
effects cease to work and become mere myths.

//Below is a summary of mythic enchantments and the datapacks they can be found in.

//**Seeker's Scope**:
//
//**Ephemeral Wings of Cloaking**:

=== Relics

Relics are powerful items added by the <<starter-item,Starter Relic>>
and/or <<relic-loot,Relic Loot>> datapacks.

A relic is a shard, trinket, or gem with impossible magic -- either a boon
enchantment, some combination of mutually exclusive enchantments, or an
enchantment that can be put on a tool that normally couldn't have it.

TO DO AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=============================

Merge loot table changes with Loot Overhaul
Add new food to relic predicate
Add new plants to Gardener Endermen and Shearless packs
Add new ores to Ore Types
Add new End blocks to Dragonproof
Add new potions to Brewing Guide
Add new hostile mobs to beheading loot table
Add new smooth & cracked blocks to stonecutter

HOW TO UPDATE LOOT TABLES AFTER MINECRAFT UPDATES
=================================================

Extract the necessary folders from the new jar

 mkdir 1.17
 cd 1.17
 jar xf ~/.minecraft/versions/1.17/1.17.jar assets data
 cd ..

Copy new loot tables to orig.new folder

 mkdir data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new
 rsync -av 1.17.jar/data/minecraft/loot_tables/{gameplay,chests} data/minecraft/loot_tables/orig.new/
 cd data/minecraft/loot_tables

Convert the original tables from YAML to JSON

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +

Compare the new and old tables using diff

 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -

If diff complains about newlines, append newlines to the new tables

 find orig.new/ -name \*.json | while read file; do echo >> "$file"; done

Edit the loot table template or what-have-you to update whatever formatting
changes Mojang made to the JSON

 vim loot_table.j2 

Repeat important steps as necessary

 find orig -name \*.yaml -exec ./yaml2json {} +
 diff -ruU10 orig orig.new/ | grep -v '^Only in' | vim -
 vim loot_table.j2 

Commit changes in the usual way
